# PrologDB Protocol

The protocol between the prologdb server is built on top of
googles [protocol buffers (protobuf)][1] version 3.

This module has three purposes:

## 1. Providing Protobuf definitions

The protobuf definitions for the protocol live in this module. A
separate artifact with **only** the \*.proto files is built and 
published with this module. Client libraries in other languages
can use that to generate their own code as a result.

## 2. Providing the Java code generated from the proto files

For convenience within this project and other Java implementations
the maven build will generate Java code from the protobuf definitions
and publish them as a separate JAR artifact.

## 3. Providing tools for working with Javas async I/O and Protobuf Messages

The Java code generated by the protobuf compiler contains only interfaces
with blocking I/O. The server architecture relies on async I/O for
networking and client implementations are likely to benefit from
async network I/O, too. Therefore, for convenience, this module also
contains code that offer async interfaces to send and receive
protobuf messages.
